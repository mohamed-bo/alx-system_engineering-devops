# 504 Error Postmortem

## Issue Summary:

-   **Duration:**
    
    -   Start Time: April 5, 2024, 8:00 PM UTC
    -   End Time: April 5, 2024, 10:30 PM UTC
-   **Impact:**
    
    -   Users attempting to access a specific URL encountered frequent 504 errors, disrupting service availability.
    -   Approximately 20% of users accessing the affected URL experienced interruptions during the outage window.
-   **Root Cause:**
    
    -   High traffic volume combined with insufficient server capacity led to gateway timeouts, resulting in the 504 errors.

## Timeline:

-   **Detection:**
    
    -   April 5, 2024, 8:15 PM UTC
    -   Monitoring systems triggered alerts for increased latency and elevated error rates for requests to the specific URL.
-   **Actions Taken:**
    
    -   Initial investigation focused on server logs and resource utilization metrics to identify performance bottlenecks.
    -   Network traffic analysis revealed a surge in incoming requests targeting the affected URL, exceeding server capacity.
-   **Misleading Paths:**
    
    -   Engineers initially suspected backend application issues, leading to unnecessary debugging efforts on application code.
-   **Escalation:**
    
    -   The incident was escalated to the infrastructure and networking teams as investigation findings pointed towards capacity limitations.
-   **Resolution:**
    
    -   Additional server instances were provisioned to handle the increased traffic load, alleviating strain on existing infrastructure.
    -   Load balancing algorithms were adjusted to distribute incoming requests more efficiently across available server resources.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

-   **Cause:**
    
    -   Insufficient server capacity to handle the sudden influx of requests resulted in gateway timeouts and 504 errors.
-   **Resolution:**
    
    -   Provisioned additional server instances to scale up capacity and accommodate the increased traffic load effectively.
    -   Optimized load balancing configurations to distribute incoming requests evenly across available server resources, mitigating gateway timeouts.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

-   **Improvements/Fixes:**
    
    -   Implement auto-scaling policies to dynamically adjust server capacity based on traffic fluctuations and demand spikes.
    -   Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time visibility into server resource utilization and identify potential capacity issues proactively.
    -   Conduct regular capacity planning assessments to ensure infrastructure scalability aligns with anticipated traffic growth.
-   **Tasks:**
    
    1.  Implement auto-scaling policies for relevant server instances by April 20, 2024, to enable dynamic resource allocation based on demand.
    2.  Enhance monitoring systems to include server resource utilization metrics and alerting for capacity thresholds by May 1, 2024.
    3.  Conduct quarterly capacity planning assessments to forecast traffic growth and adjust infrastructure scaling strategies accordingly, starting June 2024.

This postmortem outlines the duration, impact, root cause, timeline of events, and corrective/preventative measures taken in response to the 504 errors encountered while accessing a specific URL. By addressing capacity limitations and implementing proactive measures, we aim to enhance service reliability and minimize the risk of similar incidents in the future.
